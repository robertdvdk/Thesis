# Thesis
My thesis in the WUR Bioinformatics group, supervised by Dick de Ridder and Aalt-Jan van Dijk. The goal of the thesis was to build a neural network that can model the relation between promoters and proteins. For this, several different networks and network architectures were tested. The paper is included in this repo.
