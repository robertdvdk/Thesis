# Thesis
The code and paper of the my thesis in the WUR Bioinformatics group, supervised by Dick De Ridder and Aalt-Jan van Dijk. The idea of the project was to explore the viability of neural networks for modelling the relation between promoters and proteins, which we did using various different networks and network architectures. The paper is included in this repo.
